Have you ever sat down with a group of friends trying to figure out where you're going to dinner... only to finally decide on something 3 hours later? Decider has come to the rescue!

Words to know:
"Task": this is an event- something for which you're seeking input. Examples: Movie Night, Dinner, Next Vacation, etc.
"Suggestions": these are "comment" suggestions on your task. Examples: "Star Wars" for "Movie Night" task or "Paris" for "Next Vacation" task.

You can create a Task and your friends can offer their suggestions! Once you are content with the amount of suggestions, you can choose to "Randomize Suggestions" and the app will choose one of the suggestions as the "winner"!
