Have you ever sat down with a group of friends trying to figure out where you're going to dinner... only to finally decide on something 3 hours later? Decider has come to the rescue!

Words to know:
>"Task": this is an event- something for which you're seeking input. Examples: Movie Night, Dinner, Next Vacation, etc.
>"Suggestions": these are "comment" suggestions on your task. Examples: "Star Wars" for "Movie Night" task or "Paris" for "Next Vacation" task.

You can create a Task and your friends can offer their suggestions:

Once you are content with the amount of suggestions, you can choose to "Randomize Suggestions" and the app will choose one of the suggestions as the "winner"!
